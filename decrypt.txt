The Hegemony's consul sat on the balcony of his ebony-black spaceship, playing Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on a well-preserved Steinway, while from below, echoing the music, came the mooing of huge green pseudo-eggs bubbling in the squelching marsh sludge. A thunderstorm was approaching from the north. Against the leaden clouds that covered half the sky with a swirling nine-kilometre wall, a clear outline of a forest of giant horsetail trees appeared. Lightning flashed near the horizon. Vague reptilian figures appeared now and then in the blue mist near the ship, trying to penetrate the protective field, but immediately disappeared with a roar. The consul concentrated on the difficult part of the prelude, not noticing the impending storm and the thickening darkness.

The receiver of the multiline rang.

The Consul's fingers froze over the keyboard, and he turned to listen. A rumble of thunder rumbled through the stifling air. From the forest came the dull howl of a pack of scavengers. Down below, in the darkness, some mindless creature trumpeted back. Suddenly there was silence, only the humming of the protective field. Then the receiver rang again.

- Damn it! - The annoyed Consul went to answer the call.

In the few seconds it took the computer to convert and decode the packet of tachyon pulses, the Consul had time to pour himself a whiskey, and by the time the indicator light flashed green, he was sitting on the cushions in the projection alcove.

- Switch it on," he said.

- The decision has been made for your return to Hyperion," said a husky female voice. The image had not yet formed: the air in the niche shimmered only faintly, punctuated by a string of coded signals, from which the Consul understood that the message had been sent from Tau Kita, the administrative centre of the Hegemony. Consul didn't need coordinates to determine this, however. Meyna Gladstone's aged but still beautiful voice was unmistakable. And now that voice told him:

- It has been decided that you are to return to Hyperion to participate in the pilgrimage to Shrike.

'No more,' thought the Consul and stood up, about to leave the alcove.

- 'You and six others have been chosen by the Church of Shrike and approved by the Althing,' Meyna Gladstone said. - 'The Hegemony is interested in your approval.

The Consul froze on the threshold; behind him, the string running through the air continued to flicker. Without turning round, he brought the glass to his lips and finished the whisky.

- The situation is very complicated," Meyna Gladstone continued. Her voice sounded tired. - Three standard-weeks ago the Consulate and the Local Government Committee told us over the multiline that the Time Tombs seemed to be starting to open. The anti-entropic fields around them are expanding rapidly: Shrike has already been seen near Uzdecka, and is moving further south.

The Consul turned and sat back down on the cushions. The holographic projector finally came on, and Meyna Gladstone's wrinkled face appeared in the air, her eyes reddened with fatigue.

- In order to evacuate the citizens of the Hegemony on Hyperion before the Tombs of Time open, we have immediately dispatched a special squadron of VCS from Parvati. It will be in place in three Hyperion years, maybe a little later. - Meyna Gladstone paused, and the Consul thought he had never seen the Secretary of the Senate so gloomy. - We hope the evacuation party will make it in time," she said, "but another factor complicates the situation. A migratory group of Rogues, consisting of at least four thousand... units, has been detected on the approach to Hyperion. Our evacuation force is unlikely to outrun them by much.

The consul understood why Meyna Gladstone stammered. The Rogue migration group could consist of any class of ship, from single-seat scouts to flying cities and comet forts holding tens of thousands of space barbarians.

- Unified Command believes the Rogues are on the offensive," Meyna Gladstone said. The ship's computer had positioned the hologram so that the woman's sad brown eyes seemed to stare directly at the Consul. - It remained to be seen whether their target was only Hyperion and its Time Tombs, or whether they intended to move on and attack the Grid. Just in case, a full battle fleet with an attached engineering zero-T battalion has left the Kamn System to link up with the evacuation force, but depending on circumstances, that fleet could be recalled at any time.

The consul nodded and absent-mindedly brought the empty glass to his lips. He frowned, twirled it in his hands, then tossed it to the floor of the alcove, which was covered with a thick, soft carpet. While not an expert in military affairs, he nevertheless understood the complexity of the tactical challenge Gladstone and the Joint Chiefs had to face. In order to repel the Rogue invasion of the Hyperion system, it was necessary to build a military transport null-T portal in a short time (and at the cost of enormous effort!). Otherwise, the secrets of the Tombs of Time will fall into the hands of the enemies of the Hegemony. If the portal is built in time and the Hegemony throws all its forces into the defence of the remote colonial world, the Rogues could break through the weakened perimeter of the Great Grid at some other point and even - in a worst-case scenario - seize an active null-channel and penetrate the Grid. It was as if the Consul had seen hordes of these barbarians pouring out of null-portals and into the streets of unprotected cities on hundreds of planets.

He walked through the hologram of Meyna Gladstone, picked up his glass, and headed for another shot of whiskey.

- You are included in the group of pilgrims to Shrike. - The old dignitary, who was constantly being compared in the press to Lincoln, or Churchill, or Alvarez-Temp (depending on which of the legends of the pre-Hijra era was most popular at the time), seemed more preoccupied than ever. - The Templars give us their starship-tree, Yggdrasil. The evacuation force commander is instructed to let it pass. The flight to Parvati will take you three weeks; the Yggdrasil will pick up your ship and go straight into a quantum jump. The six other pilgrims chosen by the Church of Shrike will already be aboard the "tree". Our intelligence suggests that at least one of the seven pilgrims is an agent of the Rogues. We do not -- at this time -- have any way of identifying him.

The Consul smiled involuntarily. On top of all the trouble Gladstone was in, she had to reckon with the possibility that the Consul was this very spy and that she was passing strategically important information to a Vagrant agent. But was she communicating anything really important? Once the Hawking engines were switched on the ships, the fleet's movements were no longer a secret; if the Consul really was a spy, he would have taken the Senate secretary's revelations as an attempt to scare him off. The smile slipped from his face, and he took a swig of whiskey.

- The pilgrims include Sol Weintraub and Fedman Cassad," Gladstone said.

The consul frowned even more and turned his gaze to the cloud of numbers shimmering like dust around the old woman's image. There were fifteen seconds to go before the end of the communication session.

- We need your help," Meyna Gladstone finished. - We need to solve the mystery of the Tombs of Time and Shrike. This pilgrimage may be our last chance. If the Rogues take Hyperion, their agent must be destroyed and the Time Tombs closed forever - at any cost. The fate of the Hegemony depends on it.

The transmission ended. All that remained on the screen was a line of coordinates for the rendezvous point with the Yggdrasil.

- Shall we respond? - the computer asked.

Despite the enormous energy consumption, the spaceship was able to squeeze its message, compressed into a short pulse, into the silent hum of FTL conversations between the human-populated corners of the galaxy.

- No." The Consul stepped out onto the balcony and leaned on the railing. By nightfall, low clouds covered the sky, obscuring the stars. The darkness was almost total, with only occasional flashes of lightning in the north and the soft phosphorescent glow of the marsh. Suddenly the Consul realised with all clarity that he was the only intelligent being in this nameless world. He listened to the prehistoric sounds coming from the darkness and thought of the morning, of how at dawn he would leave on the Vicken and spend the day outdoors hunting big game in the fern forests to the south, then return to the ship in the evening and have a good steak dinner with a cold beer. The hunt gave him acute pleasure, but no less enjoyable was the solitude itself - a solitude he had earned through the pain and nightmare he had endured on Hyperion.

HYPERION.

The Consul returned to his quarters, cleaned the balcony and, to the accompaniment of the first heavy drops of rain, carefully closed the hatch. He climbed the spiral staircase to the top of the ship, to the sleeping compartment. The darkness of the circular room was broken now and then by silent flashes of lightning, in the light of which the surface of the transparent dome showed a grid of rain streams. The consul undressed and, making himself comfortable on the hard mattress, switched on the music centre and external microphones. The sounds of the storm raging outside mingled with the frenzy of Wagner's Flight of the Valkyries. The hurricane wind shook the ship, the dome was aflame with white flames, and the cabin was filled with the sound of thunder. The continuous flashes of fire swam before the Consul's eyes.

"Wagner should only be listened to in a thunderstorm," he thought and closed his eyes, but the lightning was visible through his eyelids. He remembered the hills near the Tombs of Time, the glittering ice crystals flying over the ruins, the cold steel gleam of Shrike, and that unimaginable tree of metal spikes. He remembered the screams in the night and the piercing gaze of Shrike's thousand-sided blood-red eyes.

HYPERION.

The Consul mentally ordered the computer to switch off all speakers and covered his eyes with his hand as silence fell. Returning to Hyperion would be sheer madness. The Tombs of Time... In his eleven years as Consul on this remote and mysterious world, the mysterious Church of Shrike had allowed at least a dozen barges carrying pilgrims from other planets onto the windswept wastelands north of the mountains. None have returned. And this in the years of calm, when the radius of the anti-entropic field around the Tombs of Time had shrunk to only a few dozen metres and the unfathomable tides of time held Shrike in place. And there was no threat of invasion by the Rogues.

What if the Shrike started walking all over the planet? Millions of Hyperionians, thousands of Hegemony citizens, all equally defenseless against a creature that recognised no physical laws and spoke only one language - death. Though the cabin was warm, the Consul felt a shiver run through him.

HYPERION.

The night had passed, the storm had subsided. But ahead of dawn, a new storm front was approaching. Two hundred metres of horsetails bent and twisted under the pressure of the air currents. And before the first ray of sunlight, the Consul's ebony-black ship rose in a column of blue plasma and, breaking through the dense clouds, hurtled into space - toward Parvati
